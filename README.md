# Formalization of the Domain of the SMRK Hamiltonian  
### A Technical Companion Note

## Overview

This document is a **purely functional-analytic companion note**.
Its purpose is to rigorously formalize:

- operator domains
- dense cores
- symmetry
- closure
- self-adjoint extension framework

No new arithmetic or spectral claims are introduced.

---

## Scope

The document focuses exclusively on:
- domain definition
- adjoint relations
- closure via graph norm
- self-adjoint extension theory

It deliberately avoids:
- conjectures
- trace formulas
- numerical analysis

---

## Why This Matters

Arithmetic Hamiltonians are typically unbounded.
Without precise domain control, spectral or trace-level claims are meaningless.

This note provides the **technical foundation** required for:
- SMRK Hamiltonian validity
- trace constructions
- spectral analysis

---

## Key Results

- Identification of a natural dense core
- Proof of symmetry on the core
- Closability of the operator
- Framework for essential self-adjointness or canonical extensions

---

## Status

**Technical foundation note.**  
Non-conjectural, supportive.

---

## Relation to Other Documents

- Supports:
  - The SMRK Hamiltonian
  - The SMRK Trace Conjecture
- Should be read as a companion, not standalone motivation

---

## Intended Audience

- Operator theorists
- Mathematical physicists
- Readers checking analytic rigor
